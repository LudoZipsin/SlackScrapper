# SlackScrapper

The name may be a little confusing since it is not really a slack scrapper nor a web scrapper. However, it's primary use is to scrap a specific web page. But it is not limited to it. Basically, it's a collection of python script that notify their result (success or failure or other) by posting them inside a slack organization.
